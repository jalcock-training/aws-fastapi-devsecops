# AWS FastAPI DevSecOps

This repository is the starting point for a full end‑to‑end **AWS DevSecOps reference
implementation**, built around a small FastAPI microservice and a fully automated, security‑focused
deployment pipeline.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a modern cloud application can be developed, secured,
tested, deployed, and monitored using **AWS**, **Terraform**, **FastAPI**, and **DevSecOps best
practices**.

## What this project will showcase

- A production‑style **FastAPI microservice** packaged as a container
- A fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions
- **Security scanning** at every stage (SAST, SCA, container scanning, IaC scanning)
- A secure AWS foundation built with **Terraform**
- Deployment to **ECS Fargate** with least‑privilege IAM roles
- Centralised logging, monitoring, and alerting
- A clean, reproducible architecture suitable for real‑world workloads

## Why this exists

This project serves as a practical demonstration of:

- Secure cloud architecture
- Infrastructure as Code discipline
- DevSecOps automation
- Application deployment pipelines
- AWS platform engineering fundamentals

It is intentionally designed to be small, clear, and technically rigorous for use as a future
reference.

## Status

**Early scaffolding phase**  
Documentation, Terraform structure, and the initial FastAPI service are being built out.

Stay tuned — the interesting parts are coming.
